# Problem statement 
The bicycle is a cheap and ecological way of transport, and it is also a healthy option. This is why the number of cyclists in cities has increased in recent years, but so has the accident rate. A study confirms that these incidents are caused by a combination of inadequate infrastructures and risk behaviour on the part of drivers and cyclists.

Bicycles may be the most eco-friendly mode of transportation that can help ease the choking of our cities. It may also be a viable solution to free up our roads from the burgeoning number of vehicles. It may be a great cost-effective alternative to tackle the bloating fuel costs and it may also be a good way to replace a sedentary lifestyle with a more healthy one. But despite all its positives, the humble bicycle invented 200 years ago, has today become one of the most dangerous vehicles, putting its riders to great risk.On India’s roads 16 fatalities take place every hour and cyclists are among those most vulnerable among the roads users apart from 2-wheeler riders and pedestrians. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways Data, 2015 report, states the Vulnerable Road Users make up for 46.3 per cent of the total fatalities. Yet another report, the Analysis of Global Road Safety 2015 done by SaveLIFE Foundation, found that road traffic deaths among pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists comprise almost half of all the deaths on roads across the world.

I propose to use on-cycle Object Detection and Image Segmentation methods to estimate traffic flow in the back, where commuters don’t have their vision. Inference and Classification from the back, is then sent to Neosensory Buzz for “immediate” response about the Motion of the Vehicle at the back, at what Distance it is from the Cycle( Using Spatial Perception), and What is the Vehicle Type in the background( Car, Truck, Motorcycle, Pedestrian etc.)

Hardware we'll use:

Our solution includes cumulative integration of Spatial Perception and Haptic Stimulus, just as the Title suggests. For the same reason, bicycles alerts have to be made in real time, from Object Detection and Depth Perception to Haptic Stimulus with low latency. So, I chose a device called the OAK-D abbreviated term for OpenCV AI Kit with Depth(Thanks to Brandon Gilles for sending this over :)), and thanks to the Neosensory Team for sending the Neosensory Buzz over for receiving real time haptics about the Spatial position of the object behind the cycle.
